Hello,

This is the new system administration team. We have found an
undocumented machine on our network that was not on our network
topology received on our first day of work.

The IP address is 172.20.242.101 and it sits on our "USER" subnet. We
have seen this IP address communicating with potentially malicious
sites and downloading files that our analysis shows could be malware.

Can you let us know if there is any information about this machine we
should know.
