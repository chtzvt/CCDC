This repo is essentially just a bunch of Linux sysadmin / defense writeups for CCDC. I essentially just searched the internet for a lot of information that I thought would be useufl, evaluated that knowledge, and typed it up into a lot of different writeups. While there is a lot of practical knowledge in here, some of it might be a bit impractical. 

When I initially wrote these, I only planned to have it be for myself / my team, so I was a bit unorganized. You will probably find some duplicate information in these files. However since I figured that I have essentially have several binders worth of writeups, that it might be good to open source them.

I have broken down my writeups into four seperate categroies:
```
+	Services:	Information related to installing / configuring / securing services like http, dns, smtp
+	Distros:	Just distro specific config information
+	Injects:	Routine tasks that we could expect to do
+	misc:		Info that doesn't fit into the other categories, but still is important, things like setting static ARP entries, effectively using Tripwrie, etc.
```

By far the most info is in the `Services` section, which also does hold a lot of distro specific info. 

Also I feel like it might be relevant if anyone who is playing in CCDC, if you want some info related to what you can expect to see, I would recommend checking out this repo: https://github.com/mubix/howtowinccdc
