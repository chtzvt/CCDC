# Request for an extra laptop

We request an extra workstation for use in our business operations.

## Justification
Adding an extra laptop workstation to our inventory of tools allows us to further add security features to our company's current network infrastructure. With this workstation we could, for example, set up a secure jump host for managing corporate infrastructure. We could also use this workstation as an IDS/IPS solution so as to only allow trusted and official communications within corporate networks.
