# Why both options suck ass

- Both OSSIM and QRadar are commercial products, and their functionality is limited without a license from their respective parent companies
- While QRadar requires at least 50GB of RAM to function properly, OSSIM does not and thus costs less in terms of hardware.
- Whereas OSSIM uses basic Snort analysis tooling, QRadar uses larger-scale machine learning algorithms to spot patterns and analyze security events in real time
- Where any company can deploy OSSIM as they want, most QRadar systems deployed are managed by IBM MSS through an MSSP agreement.
- QRadar has a native integration with the IBM Watson:tm: platform, which uses the power of machine learning to provide network administrators and security personnel with unprecedented visibility into next-generation cyber threats (edited)
