Hello and welcome to Acme, inc. This file serves as a primer to company policy for our new employees.
Before doing anything else, please take time to read and understand the rules below.

First and foremost, you should be honored to have the privilige of associating into our corporate mass. Don't get cocky about it! Remember
that you can be easily replaced at any time for any reason. It's nothing personal, but we've found that keeping our workers in constant fear is
a much cheaper and more effective stimulant than all the half-dozens of dollars we were spending in the past just to provide them with coffee.

Never look your boss in the eyes. Do not acknowledge those above you unless prompted. When approached by your superiors, you are expected to first
kneel before them and beg for forgiveness before proceeding.

You are welcome to join us for the annual company potluck, during which we sacrifice the weakest employees to the omnipotent invisible hand. Understand
that weakness must be cleansed to protect the whole. Serve the hand, or be served to him.

Do not, under any circumstances, engage with Jim from marketing. He is very volatile. We can't fire him because he says that if he loses his job
then he'll burn down our building, which would ruin the building burning party we had planned for November. I spent a lot of money on a special
golden flamethrower with both my name and the company's name engraved on it, because I care about my employees. It's one of my prized posessions
and I'll be damned if Jim beats me to burning everything to cinders with his stupid matches before I can whip that baby out.

Don't forget that as a convenience, sporks are provided free of charge in the break room.

ANY violation of the above rules will result in a trip to the "time-out corner"!

- Richard M. Francis, CEO.
